**Note**: 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency codebase follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
1-webpage meets accessibility standards.
2-webpage has a semantic HTML elements.
3-elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
4-image elements has accessible alt attributes.
5-the title element has a concise, descriptive title.
```


**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
